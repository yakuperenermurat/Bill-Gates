# Bill Gates Project

This project simulates a shopping experience where users can explore how they'd spend a large sum of money, inspired by Bill Gates' wealth. Users can "buy" items, track their remaining balance, and review a receipt of their purchases.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this application is to provide a fun and educational experience, allowing users to explore the scale of wealth by simulating spending choices. This interactive project aims to bring financial concepts closer to users through a visual, hands-on approach.
